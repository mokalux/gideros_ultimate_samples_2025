# Nebula Retro

An open source platform game which allows the user to edit/create new
levels. The game was written in Lua using Gideros
(http://giderosmobile.com). As such it can be exported for any OS
Gideros supports including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, desktop and
HTML5. On desktop systems you control the game using keyboard (default
controls are left, right and ctrl, you can redefine them from the
Options menu). On mobile devices, touch controls appear which can be
adjusted from the options menu.

In either case, the game can be played in landscape or portrait
mode. In portrait mode the user can edit levels he has completed and
create new ones.
