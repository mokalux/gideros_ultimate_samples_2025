++ FIXED getSpeed() release anim speed not in MS (re-check you code PLEASE!)
++ FIXED if No Stop Frame defined in Editor for an animation = Error on self.anim.free() 
++ FIXED self:anim:setLoop() 
		now if loop is set to false and ot "stopOnFrame" is not defined,  animator play all animation frames and stop on last frame.
		if StopOnFrames is defined animator play all animation frames and then stop one fame defined in "stopOnFrame".
		*** PLEASE RE-EXPORT YOUR ANIMATOR PROJECT. ***

++ Added function CTNTAnimator:animationExists(animationName) - release true if exists else release false.
