BhDemoShield for Gideros
========================

A pair of "demonstration hands" for your app promos that probably look more presentable than your own sorry paws. Simply add BhDemoShield.lua and the two hand png files temporarily to your project. The hands work with multi-touch but only really look right with a maximum of two touches.

There is a demo program called SoftHands to show how this works in practice.

Folder Structure
----------------

This module is part of the general Bowerhaus library for Gideros mobile. There are a number of cooperating modules in this library, each with it's own Git repository. In order that the example project files will run correctly "out of the box" you should create an appropriate directory structure and clone/copy the files within it.
