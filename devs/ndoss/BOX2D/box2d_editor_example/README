Software used in this proof of concept:

* Gideros Mobile (http://www.giderosmobile.com/)
* JSON4Lua library (http://json.luaforge.net/)
* Box2d-Editor (http://code.google.com/p/box2d-editor/)


How to create a new json file and run it:

* Create json project in box2d-editor, trace images, save json file
* Edit main.lua to use the json file you just created, run project

Issues:

* Images don't align w/ box2d elements (uncomment code in main.lua to see)
  Not sure what the right transform is.
