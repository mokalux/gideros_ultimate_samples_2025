It's nothing exciting, just the standard IFS stuff you see here and there. \n\tLike many examples, this particular one is based on Syntopia and Knighty's work.\n\n    The construction is pretty similar to that of an infinite sponge, but it has a bit of rotating, \n\tfolding, stretching, etc, thrown into the mix.\n\n    The blueish environmental lighting is experimental, and based on XT95s environment mapping in \n\this UI example. The idea is very simple: Instead of passing a reflective ray into a cubic \n\ttexture in cartesian form, convert it to its polar angles, then index into a 2D texture. The \n\tresults are abstract, and no substitute for the real thing, but not too bad, all things \n\tconsidered.\n\n\tThe comments are a little rushed, but I'll tidy them up later.\n\n\tExamples and references:\n\n    Menger Journey - Syntopia\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Mdf3z7\n\n    \/\/ Explains the process in more detail.\n    Kaleidoscopic (escape time) IFS - Knighty\n    http:\/\/www.fractalforums.com\/ifs-iterated-function-systems\/kaleidoscopic-(escape-time-ifs)\/\n\n    Ancient Generators - Zackpudil\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/4sGXzV\n\n*\/\n\n#define FAR 40.\n\nfloat hash( float n ){ return fract(cos(n)*45758.5453); }\n\n\/\/ Tri-Planar blending function.
